I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from the [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/), working under the supervision of Dr [Yi Mei](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/Main/YiMei) and Professor [Mengjie Zhang](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/Main/MengjieZhang) in the [Evolutionary Computation Research Group](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/Groups/ECRG/).

My research interests are mostly in the area of machine learning, evolutionary computation, combinatorial optimisation and transfer learning.
